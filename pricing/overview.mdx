## ðŸ’¡ Plan, Pricing, and Tier Structure Explained

This diagram represents a **multi-layered pricing architecture** for a subscription-based product or service. It is structured into three key layers:

### ðŸ§± Top Level: **Plan**

- **Plan Nama**: "Annual Subscription"
- **Plan Types: **
- This is the overarching offering to the customer.
- A **plan** is what a customer ultimately subscribes toâ€”it defines the billing cycle (in this case, **annually**) and may include access to different **pricing models** or tiers underneath it.
- A single plan can include multiple pricing groups, as seen here with two separate pricing sections under one annual subscription.

### ðŸ’² Mid Level: **Pricing**

- **Label**: "2025 Pricing", "2026 Pricing"
- Each pricing block likely represents a **different region, customer segment, A/B test group, or reseller partner** under the same plan.
- The example plan contains **two separate pricing groups**, each defining their own set of tier prices.
- This allows you to version or localize pricing while keeping it under the same overall subscription umbrella.

Examples:

- Pricing Group A might be for existing customers grandfathered into older rates.
- Pricing Group B could reflect updated rates for new customers in 2025.

### ðŸ§© Bottom Level: **Tiers**

- Each pricing group defines **three distinct pricing tiers**:
  - **Gold**
  - **Platinum**
  - **Ultimate**
- **Group A Tiers**:
  - Gold: \$10
  - Platinum: \$15
  - Ultimate: \$25
- **Group B Tiers**:
  - Gold: \$12
  - Platinum: \$17
  - Ultimate: \$27
- Tiers represent **feature-based or usage-based differentiators**. For example:
  - Gold might offer basic features.
  - Platinum could include additional analytics or integrations.
  - Ultimate might unlock unlimited usage, premium support, etc.

## ðŸ§  Summary

- A **Plan** defines the billing schedule and gives access to pricing groups.
- **Pricing** versions under the same plan allow for flexibility in price points or regional/customer targeting.
- **Tiers** within each pricing version define the actual product access levels and associated pricing.

This structure is ideal for:

- A/B pricing experiments
- Geo-based pricing
- Transitioning from old to new pricing
- Allowing resellers to define their own markup while maintaining core plan structure
