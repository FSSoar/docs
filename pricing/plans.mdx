- **Tiers** specify the pricing structure (e.g., _Silver_, _Gold_, _0‚Äì1000 emails_, etc.) within each Pricing Group.

There are 4 types of plans you can choose from:

- **Fixed Rate**\
  A flat fee billed on a set cadence (e.g., \$10/month for Netflix).
- **Graduated Rates**\
  Tiered pricing based on **usage metrics**.\
  Example:
  - 0‚Äì1000 emails

  Tiered pricing **not based on usage**.\
